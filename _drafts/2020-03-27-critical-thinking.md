## The Short Version
You should defer to the expert consensus instead of thinking critically.

## The puzzle
{: id="anchor"}

This is a personal favorite of mine from Michael Huemer (2005).[^paper]
Take any controversial public issue of your time. For me, this includes
issues such as abortion and gun rights. There are at least 3 strategies you
may employ to make up your mind on the matter: (1) deference--adopt
the belief that most experts hold, (2) critical thinking--after
conducting your own investigation of the issue, you assess the
arguments and evidence to come to your own conclusion, (3) skepticism--withhold
judgment on the issue.[^discrepancy] The puzzle is this: which
strategy should you choose?

[^paper]: Huemer, M. (2005). Is critical thinking epistemically responsible? *Metaphilosophy* 36(4), 522-531.

[^discrepancy]: Huemer actually calls (1) 'credulity', but I think 'deference' is a better name.

To help us choose, Huemer takes us on a quick detour with a simple
thought experiment. Consider two devices, A and B, that measure some
property F. A is 80 percent accurate, meaning "80 percent
of the time it correctly reports
whether a thing is F," and B is 60 percent accurate (Huemer, 524).
Presumably, you would choose device A to figure out if something is F.
You want to use the device that is more accurate.

With this conclusion in mind, consider for a moment just deference
and critical thinking. By using deference, you are more likely to
form a true belief because an expert, especially a group of experts,
is more likely than you (assuming you are a layperson on the issue)
to arrive at a true belief on the matter. In this way, choosing
deference is like choosing device A from above over device B.

  For me, this is a deeply disturbing conclusion. We
  preach the importance of critical thinking, but this
  argument shows that if we care about having true beliefs
  we should defer to the experts.

Deference is more accurate than critical thinking so by the
same reasoning that we choose device B we should choose deference
over critical thinking.
