## The Short Version
The moral grandstander seeks to appear morally respectable to others but in doing so she makes public moral discourse less effective and disrespects other participants of
public moral discourse.

<!--cut-->

## Why should you care about this?
It's needless to say that public moral discourse is important. Without at least first discussing the moral issues of our time, how else can we expect to improve the society or
community we live in?

However, as Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke argue, moral grandstanding
or what might be more familiarly known as virtue signaling threatens to undermine
our public moral discourse.[^paper]

What is it and why exactly is it bad? Tosi & Warmke offer their own account of moral grandstanding, but disappointingly enough don't also offer a solution (they don't think this lies in their expertise). **But fear
not!** To defeat an enemy, you must first understand her.

## Who is the grandstander?
{: id="anchor"}

The moral grandstander is someone who seeks to satisfy the recognition desire&mdash;the desire to appear morally respectable to others.[^brevity]

I might want others to
think I hold "respectable moral beliefs" or that I make respectable moral
judgments (p.201). This recognition desire is the driving motivation for grandstanders, and I think it's an understandable motivation.[^admit] I don't want other people to think
that I torture puppies for fun.[^mean]

[^brevity]: For the sake of brevity, when I say grandstander, I mean moral grandstander. When I say grandstanding, I mean moral grandstanding.

[^admit]: Tosi and Warmke admit that this recognition desire may not be present at all in some cases of grandstanding so they focus on the paradigmatic cases of grandstanding.

[^mean]: I mean that I don't torture puppies for fun, and I would never want someone to think that I do. This is not a case where I do torture puppies for fun, but I don't want others to think that I do (though this does get into interesting philosophical territory).

## What does the grandstander do?

The grandstander uses public moral discourse to show others that she is morally
respectable. Public moral discourse (as Tosi & Warmke seem to use it) is an
umbrella term for any public talk about moral issues. This could be the comments
you see on Facebook when a tragic event happens or debates between pundits on
news networks.

The grandstander may contribute to this sort of public moral discourse in 5 ways:

<ol>
  <li>Piling on</li>
  <li>Ramping up</li>
  <li>Trumping up</li>
  <li>Excessive emotional displays</li>
  <li>Claims of self-evidence</li>
  (p.203)
</ol>

### Piling on
Piling on is repeating what has already been said to "register" yourself on one
side of a moral issue (p.204).

Let's see this in action. Imagine a situation where three friends&mdash;Jocko, Xena, and Trevor&mdash;are discussing the recent actions of their city's mayor. Trevor says
at some point, "I really don't think that was okay to do." If Jocko and Xena pile
on, they might say something like, "Yeah, I agree!" or "Definitely!"

Notice that Jocko and Xena's statements don't actually add anything to the discussion.
Instead, they are just registering their position on the issue with everyone else.
Now, everyone knows where Jocko and Xena stand on this issue, but nothing more of
substance has been added. Why might Jocko and Xena do this? They do this because they want others to think that they also see the moral issue or that they also hold respectable moral beliefs like Trevor. In other words, they want to appear morally respectable to
others.

Tosi & Warmke also bring in the phenomenon of social comparison from social psychology
to explain piling on. People want to appear favorably to others so in group deliberation
they will agree with the dominant position. In the example above, Jocko and Xena
might want to appear favorably to Trevor and one way of doing this is to register their
position with him.

### Ramping up
Ramping up is making increasingly more dramatic claims about how to respond to
a moral issue. Imagine back to the discussion that Jocko, Xena, and Trevor were
having. Trevor might say, "I think we should create a petition for this." Then, if
Jocko and Xena ramp up, Xena might say, "No, what we should really be doing is
asking for his resignation" and then Jocko might say, "No, if we're taking this
seriously we should be seeking criminal charges. I'll go call my lawyer right now."[^maybe]

[^maybe]: Maybe Jocko won't actually say that last bit.

In this situation, Jocko and Xena are contributing to the discussion, but something
seems to have gone terribly wrong. Tosi & Warmke think that Jocko and Xena
are trying to show that they are more morally respectable than the others.
This is a sort of one-upping others in terms of moral respectability.

Social psychology can also explain what's happening here. Jocko and Xena (as well
as us) believe themselves to hold some relative position of moral respectability.
Jocko might think that on the totem pole of moral respectability he's at the top and Xena
and Trevor are below him. Then, to preserve this world view, Jocko needs to outdo
the others by ramping up their claims.

### Trumping up
Trumping up is pointing out a moral problem when there is, in fact, none. This
can be explained by the fact that the grandstander wants to show others that she
has a keener eye for moral problems. This is another way of trying to appear
more morally respectable than others. The rationale is something like this: because
I see the moral problems that other people are blind to, I am better than them.[^arrogant]

[^arrogant]: To me, this sounds laughably arrogant. It rings of a savior complex.

### Excessive emotional displays
Excessive emotional displays are self-explanatory. By displaying my emotional
outrage at a moral issue, I am showing others the strength of my moral conviction. This show of outrage helps me appear morally respectable to others.

### Claims of self-evidence
Claims of self-evidence may be statements like "Of course this is wrong!" or "How could you think this is alright?" By themselves, these claims don't seem entirely malicious, but when asserted in discussions where it's not obvious which side is right on a moral issue, it quickly becomes an issue. By claiming one side of a moral issue is obviously right, the grandstander shows that her "moral sensibilities are more finely tuned than those of others" (p.208). This is just another way of showing that the grandstander is more morally respectable than others.

Tosi & Warmke argue that because their account can explain all 5 ways that
grandstanders contribute to public moral discourse their account is correct.[^worry]

[^worry]: One worry I have is that though their account may smoothly explain these 5 ways a grandstander acts why does this mean it actually explains what is going on in a grandstander's head? The account might not line up with reality.

## What is bad about grandstanding?
The grandstander ends up harming other participants of public moral discourse.
Tosi & Warmke think this happens in two different ways.

The first has to do with public moral discourse itself. By grandstanding, the
grandstander contributes to three problems with discourse: (1) "increased cynicism",
(2) "outrage exhaustion", and (3) "group polarization" (p.210).

We might become more cynical about public moral discourse because we might start
to think that everyone is just grandstanding. No one sincerely means what
they are saying.

We might also be less inclined to express emotional outrage because the act is
cheapened by the grandstanders who display emotional outrage. Our emotional outrage
doesn't seem as significant if everyone else is doing the same.
<!-- This actually doesn't seem right -->

Piling on and ramping up contribute to group polarization. A group might start
its moral deliberation with some moderate claims and then end up with
radical claims that few people would actually be on board with. This would lend
to the view that moral discourse "consists primarily of extreme and implausible claims,"
discouraging people from participating (p.212).

The second has to do with the participants of public moral discourse. Tosi & Warmke
think that the grandstander free rides off of the work done by participants of
public moral discourse. The grandstander makes loud claims about some moral issue
and then the participants may work to solve this moral issue. But in the end, the
grandstander gets all the credit for raising awareness about the issue in the
first place.[^second_worry]

[^second_worry]: My worry here is that I think Tosi & Warmke are right to think that it's wrong for the grandstander to get *all* the credit, but doesn't some credit need to go to the person who first raised awareness about the issue? I'm thinking specifically about how journalists or whistleblowers raise the alarm on important moral issues.

All this covers Tosi & Warmke's account of grandstanding, and I hope this was as insightful
for you as it was for me!
