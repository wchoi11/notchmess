<h2>Trying to make philosophy a little more accessible</h2>
<p>
    I've always found papers in philosophy to hit that sweetspot between too long and too short. They usually aim at one
    small but substantial point that makes you go "Oh, I never thought about it that way!" I believe this makes philosophy
    papers prime content for sharing with others so I've tried to recreate the conversations I've had with others
    about papers I've read. Just like how <a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/">PEL</a>
    tries to recreate those conversations in the pub after a seminar, these posts try to recreate the conversations I've
    had over a meal after finishing a paper for one of my classes. I try to pick papers that I think (1) you will find interesting
    and (2) makes a point that you're better off knowing.
</p>
<p>
    I've also come to realize that there are bound to be other undergraduates in philosophy who might appreciate an
    explanation of some paper that they've been assigned. There are plenty of times that I've spent banging my head
    against the wall trying to understand a paper, and I hope this might prove useful for those who might be in the
    same situation as I have.
</p>

<h2>A disclaimer</h2>
<p>
    Inevitably, I will get things wrong. I could wildly misinterpret a key point or the entire argument of one of the
    papers. I try my best to get things right, but these posts aren't submitted to peer-reviewed journals so who knows
    what I could get wrong. The best remedy for this is to let me know if you think I got something wrong or read the
    paper yourself! My end goal is really to get people to read these papers on their own so I would consider that a
    success.
