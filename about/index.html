    <h2>Trying to make philosophy a little more accessible</h2>
    <p>
        I've always found papers in philosophy (at least the ones I like) to aim at one
        small but substantial point that makes you go "Oh, I never thought about it that way!" This makes philosophy
        papers prime content for sharing with others since the arguments are short and don't require much background to understand.
        I try to pick papers that I think (1) you will find interesting and (2) makes a point you're better off knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've also come to realize that there are bound to be fellow undergraduates in philosophy who might appreciate a
        summary of a paper they're reading. There are plenty of times that I've spent banging my head
        against the wall trying to understand a paper, and I hope this might prove useful for those who might be in the
        same situation and continue to find themselves in similar ones like myself.

    <h2>A disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        Inevitably, I will get things wrong. I could wildly misinterpret a key point or the entire argument of one of the
        papers. I try my best to get things right, but these posts aren't submitted to peer-reviewed journals so who knows
        what I could get wrong. The best remedy for this is to let me know if you think I got something wrong or read the
        paper yourself! My end goal is really to get people to read these papers on their own so I would consider that a
        success.
