<h2>Trying to make philosophy a little more accessible</h2>
<p>
    I've always found papers in philosophy to hit that sweetspot between too long and too short. They usually aim at one
    small but substantial point that makes you go "Oh, I never thought about it that way!" This makes philosophy
    papers prime content for sharing with others. This is my attempt to recreate the conversations I've had with others
    on papers I've read. Just like how <a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/">PEL</a>
    tries to recreate those conversations in the pub after a seminar, these posts try to recreate the conversations I've
    had after finishing a paper for one of my classes. I try to pick papers that I think (a) others will find interesting
    and (b) makes a point that you're better off knowing.
</p>

<h2>A disclaimer</h2>
<p>
    Inevitably, I will get things wrong. I could wildly misinterpret a key point or the entire argument of one of the
    papers. I try my best to get things right, but these posts aren't submitted to peer-reviewed journals so who knows
    what I could get wrong. The best remedy for this is to let me know if you think I got something wrong or read the
    paper yourself! My end goal is really to get people to read these papers on their own so I would consider that a
    success.
