<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p>Trying to make philosophy a little more accessible.</p>

<h2>The Long Version</h2>
<p>
    I've always found papers in philosophy to hit that sweetspot between too long and too short. They usually aim at one
    small but substantial point that makes you go "Oh, I never thought about it that way!" For me, this makes  philosophy
    papers prime content for sharing with others, and I always try to bring it up in interesting ways to friends. This is
    my attempt to recreate that magic from those conversations. Just like how
    <a href="https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/">PEL</a> tries to recreate those conversations in the pub after a seminar,
    these posts try to recreate the conversations I've had after finishing a paper for one of my classes. I try to pick
    papers that (i) I think others will find interesting and (ii) I think makes a point that you're better off knowing.
