## The Short Version
Because of how probability works, 
you shouldn't believe someone who tells you she has witnessed a miracle.

## The puzzle
{: id="anchor"}

Should you believe someone who tells you she has witnessed
a miracle? This is a question David Hume—-the philosopher
known as "the Great infidel" during his time--answers
with a resounding "No".

## Two definitions

We usually think of miracles as events like walking on water
or turning water into wine. As these examples suggest, Hume
is concerned with religious miracles and not just any
highly improbable event. Hume defines miracles as a violation
of a law of nature or what we think of as laws of physics.

But this is not quite right either. Hume defines laws of natures
as a kind of regularity in our experiences without exceptions.
This means "the sun will rise tomorrow" is a law of nature because
it has always happened in the past without exception. It would be
a stretch to say this is a law of physics.

## Hájek's reading
Alan Hájek (2008) defends Hume's argument against a common type of
criticism and criticizes it in his own way.[^paper]

[^paper]: Hájek, Alan. “Are Miracles Chimerical?” In *Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Religion. Vol. 1*. Edited by Kvanvig, Jonathan L. Oxford; New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 2008.

### Hume's balancing principle
Part of
Hume's argument depends on his so-called balancing principle: "The
testimony should be believed if, and only if, the falsehood of the
testimony is less probable than the event attested to" (Hájek, 94).

To see how this works, consider Hume's example of hearing from someone
who claims he saw a dead person come back to life. By the balancing
principle, we should compare the probability of this person's
testimony being false and the probability of a dead person coming
back to life. Whatever we think the probabilities are, Hume thinks
we should assign greater probability to the person's testimony being
false. It is more likely the person is deceived or delusional. This
means we should not believe that a dead person has come back to life.

Hume's argument goes that we should never believe someone who
claims to have witnessed a miracle because by the balancing
principle the probabilities will never work out so that we
should believe the testimony.

The main objection to the balancing principle
is that if we accept the balancing principle then we should reject
people who report to us historical events or improbable events like
winning the lottery.

For example, if my local newspaper reports that Alice has won the lottery
then by the balancing principle I should compare the probabilities of the
newspaper's report being false and Alice winning the lottery. Alice's
chances of winning the lottery are extremely small compared to the
probability of the newspaper's report being wrong. This means that
we should not believe the newspaper's report because the probability
of the newspaper falsely reporting the winner of the lottery is larger
than the probability of Alice winning the lottery.

We can imagine similar examples of testimony of highly improbable events
and come out with the conclusion that if we use the balancing principle
we cannot believe such testimony. But this is absurd. We believe what
historians tell us and we believe newspapers when they tell us who won
the lottery. It can't be the case that we were always wrong to believe so.
Thus, we should reject the balancing principle which got us into this mess.

Hájek thinks we have failed to notice something in these sorts of
examples. What we have missed is that the probability of the event
attested to actually changes after we receive a report. We are
right to think that, for example, Alice's chances of winning the
lottery are miniscule. But after we read the newspaper's report
that Alice won the lottery, we should update that probability to
be much bigger. Why so? Because we think the newspaper is reliable,
we should assign high probability to the newspaper's report being

  If the probability of the newspaper's report being false
  is $10^{-3}$, then the probability of the newspaper's report
  being true or the probability that Alice won the lottery is
  $1 - 10^{-3}$. Clearly, $10^{-3} < 1 - 10^{-3}$.

true. This means that the probability of the newspaper's report being
false is now smaller than the probability of Alice winning the lottery
(post-report) so we should believe the newspaper.

### Analogical probability

Another important part of Hume's argument that Hájek points out
is the notion of analogical probability or this new sense of
probability that Hume has. The reason Hume needs this other sense of
probability is that miracles are not
simply improbable as we might understand winning the lottery is.

Miracles are improbable in the sense that they are infrequent, but
they are also further improbable in the sense that they are
disanalogous to anything from our past experiences. My winning
the lottery is highly improbable, but it is not disanalogous
to anything from my past experiences. I might have experienced
winning with a similar sort of drawing or I've almost surely
seen someone else winning a lottery. In other words, my winning
the lottery is an event that resembles events from my past experience.

  the bible counts.
</span>
But with events like a dead person coming back to life, these events
don't resemble any events from my past experience. This means miracles
are improbable in the analogical probability sense as opposed to
simply improbable events like winning the lottery.

Hume's notion of analogical probability helps to determine the
probabilities to use with the balancing principle. Only miracles
are highly improbable unlike events like winning the lottery. This
also helps Hume avoid the main objection to the balancing principle
we covered above.

But Hájek points out that something goes terribly wrong if we use
Hume's notion of analogical probability. Just as we would reject
testimony of miracles, we would also have to reject testimony of
certain scientific findings.

Consider that certain astronomical and quantum mechanical phenomena
do not resemble anything from our past experiences. This means that
they are not only simply improbable but also improbable in the sense
of analogical probability. Then, testimony of these scientific phenomena is
treated the same way as testimony of miracles are: rejection.

Hájek thinks this is an absurd conclusion so we should reject Hume's
use of analogical probability. This doesn't mean Hume's argument for
rejecting the testimony of miracles fails but just that we shouldn't
take Hume on his word.
