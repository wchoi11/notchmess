## The Short Version
The moral grandstander seeks to appear morally respectable to others but in doing so she makes public moral discourse less effective and harms other participants of
public moral discourse.

<!--cut-->

## Why should you care about this?
It's needless to say that public moral discourse is important. Without first discussing the moral issues of our time, how else can we expect moral improvement in the society or
community we live in?

However, as Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke argue, moral grandstanding
or what might be more familiarly known as virtue signaling threatens to undermine
our public moral discourse.[^paper] [^virtue_signaling]

What is moral grandstanding and why exactly is it bad? Tosi & Warmke offer their
own account of moral grandstanding, but disappointingly don't also offer
a solution (this is not the main topic of their paper). **But fear
not!** To defeat the enemy, you must first understand her.

[^paper]: "Moral Grandstanding," *Philosophy & Public Affairs* 44:3 (2016):p.197-217. Tosi & Warmke have also written a layman explanation of their paper [here](https://aeon.co/ideas/moral-grandstanding-theres-a-lot-of-it-about-all-of-it-bad).

[^virtue_signaling]: Interestingly enough, Tosi & Warmke don't like the term "virtue signaling." See their reason [here](https://aeon.co/ideas/moral-grandstanding-theres-a-lot-of-it-about-all-of-it-bad).

## Who is the grandstander?
{: id="anchor"}

The moral grandstander is someone who seeks to satisfy her recognition desire&mdash;the desire to appear morally respectable to others.[^brevity]

I might want others to think I hold "respectable moral beliefs" or that I make respectable moral
judgments (p.201). This recognition desire is the driving motivation for grandstanders,
and I think it's an understandable motivation.[^admit] I don't want other people to think
that I torture puppies for fun.[^mean]

[^brevity]: For the sake of brevity, when I say grandstander, I mean moral grandstander. When I say grandstanding, I mean moral grandstanding.

[^admit]: Tosi and Warmke admit that this recognition desire may not be present at all in some cases of grandstanding so they focus on the paradigmatic cases of grandstanding.

[^mean]: Let me clarify here that I don't torture puppies for fun, and I would never want someone to think that I do. This is not a case where I do torture puppies for fun and don't want others to think that I do (though this does get into interesting philosophical territory).

## What does the grandstander do?

The grandstander uses public moral discourse to show others that she is morally
respectable. Public moral discourse (as Tosi & Warmke seem to use it) is an
umbrella term for any public talk about moral issues. This includes the comments
you see on Facebook or the debates between pundits on news networks.

The grandstander may contribute to this sort of public moral discourse in 5 ways:

<ol class="argument">
  <li>Piling on</li>
  <li>Ramping up</li>
  <li>Trumping up</li>
  <li>Excessive emotional displays</li>
  <li>Claims of self-evidence</li>
</ol>

### Piling on
Piling on is repeating what has already been said to "register" yourself on one
side of a moral issue (p.204).

Imagine a situation where three friends&mdash;Jocko, Xena, and Trevor&mdash;are discussing the recent actions of their city's mayor. Trevor says
at some point, "I really don't think that was okay to do." If Jocko and Xena pile
on, they might say something like, "Yeah, I agree!" or "Definitely!"

Notice that Jocko and Xena's statements don't actually add anything to the discussion (harsh, but true!).
Instead, they are just broadcasting their position to everyone else.
Now, everyone knows where Jocko and Xena stand, but nothing more of
substance has been added. Why might Jocko and Xena do this? They do this because they want others to think that they also see the moral issue or that they also hold respectable moral beliefs like Trevor. In other words, they want to appear morally respectable to
others.

Tosi & Warmke also cite the phenomenon of social comparison from social psychology
to explain piling on. People want to appear favorably to others so in group deliberation
they will agree with the dominant position. In the example above, Jocko and Xena
might want to appear favorably to everyone else and one way of doing this is to register their
position with the group.

### Ramping up
Ramping up is making increasingly more dramatic claims about how to respond to
a moral issue. Imagine back to the discussion that Jocko, Xena, and Trevor were
having. Trevor might say, "I think we should create a petition for this." Then, if
Jocko and Xena ramp up, Xena might say, "No, what we should really be doing is
asking for his resignation" and then Jocko might say, "No, if we're taking this
seriously we should be seeking criminal charges. I'll go call my lawyer right now." [^maybe]

[^maybe]: Okay, maybe Jocko won't actually say that last bit.

In this situation, Jocko and Xena are contributing to the discussion, but something
seems to have gone terribly wrong. Tosi & Warmke think that Jocko and Xena
are trying to show that they are more morally respectable than the others.
They're one-upping each other in terms of moral respectability.

Social psychology can also explain what's happening here. Jocko and Xena believe
themselves (as do we) to hold some relative position of moral respectability in the group.
Jocko might think that on the totem pole of moral respectability he's at the top and Xena
and Trevor are below him. To preserve this world view, Jocko needs to outdo
the others by ramping up their claims. If Xena says they need to seek the mayor's
resignation, Jocko *needs* to do better than this to maintain his moral superiority.

### Trumping up
Trumping up is pointing out a moral problem when there is, in fact, none. This
can be explained by the fact that the grandstander wants to show others that she
has a keener eye for moral problems. The grandstander believes that if she is successful
she will appear more morally respectable than others. The rationale is something like this: because
other people think I see the moral problems that others are blind to, I am better than others
(great reasoning right?).

### Excessive emotional displays
Excessive emotional displays are self-explanatory. By displaying my emotional
outrage at a moral issue, I am showing others the strength of my moral conviction.
This show of outrage helps me appear morally respectable to others by showing
others that I care about the issue this much.

### Claims of self-evidence
Claims of self-evidence are statements like "Of course this is wrong!" and "How could you think this is alright?" By themselves, these claims don't seem entirely malicious, but when asserted in discussions on a moral issue where it's not obvious which side is right, it quickly becomes problematic. By claiming one side of a moral issue is obviously right, the grandstander tries to show that her "moral sensibilities are more finely tuned than those of others" (p.208). The grandstander wants others to think that she is better at figuring out what is moral and what is not. This is just another way of the grandstander trying to show that she is more morally respectable than others.

And that wraps up all 5 things the grandstander may do. Tosi & Warmke argue that
their account is correct because their account can explain all 5 ways that
grandstanders contribute to public moral discourse.[^worry]

[^worry]: One worry I have is that though their account may smoothly explain the 5 ways a grandstander acts, how does this actually explain what is going on in a grandstander's head? The account might not line up with reality so Tosi & Warmke seem to be assuming "If an account of a phenomenon explains all aspects of that phenomenon, the account is true."

## What is bad about grandstanding?
Tosi & Warmke discuss a variety of problems, but I'll focus on four problems the
grandstander creates for moral discourse and its participants.

The first is that we might become more cynical about public moral discourse because we start
to think that everyone is just grandstanding. No one sincerely means what
they are saying. It's all just a narcissistic act to improve your moral reputation.

The second problem is that we might also be less inclined to express emotional outrage because the act is
cheapened by the grandstanders who also display outrage. Our emotional outrage
doesn't seem as significant if everyone else is doing the same.
<!-- This actually doesn't seem right -->

Piling on and ramping up lead us to the third problem of group polarization. A group might start
its moral deliberation with some moderate claims only to end up with
radical claims that few people would actually be on board with. Polarization lends
to the view that moral discourse "consists primarily of extreme and implausible claims,"
discouraging people from participating (p.212).

Lastly, Tosi & Warmke think that the grandstander free rides off of the work done by participants of
public moral discourse. The grandstander makes loud claims about some moral issue
to raise awareness and then the participants of public moral discourse who
become aware of this issue may work to solve it.
Their solution might be to organize protests to increase social pressure for reform. But in the end,
Tosi & Warmke think that the grandstander unfairly gets public recognition for solving
the moral issue while not actually working to solve the issue.[^second_worry]

[^second_worry]: My worry here is that Tosi & Warmke seem to think that it's wrong for the grandstander to get public recognition for solving a moral issue when the grandstander might not have done anything to help. I'm thinking specifically about how it seems right to praise journalists or whistleblowers for raising the alarm on important moral issues.

## Some qualifications
Having said all this, Tosi & Warmke don't think that **all** grandstanding is bad.
There may be cases where **not** grandstanding is worse.

I think the most interesting qualification Tosi & Warmke make is that it doesn't
follow from their account that we should discourage or blame people for grandstanding.
Their reasoning for this claim doesn't seem to appear in the paper, but it
does appear in the [Aeon article](https://aeon.co/ideas/moral-grandstanding-theres-a-lot-of-it-about-all-of-it-bad)
they wrote.

Their reasoning goes like this. Tosi & Warmke think that trying to find the grandstanders
shouldn't be a priority. Our priority should be to contribute to public moral discourse
in a way that improves our society or community.

Furthermore, it's
impossible for us to identify grandstanders unless we have access to their thoughts.
Instead of focusing on the difficult task of identifying the grandstanders, what we should
do is consider whether we are a grandstander. After all, we have access to our own thoughts.
In the end, the enemy we should first look to defeat is not one of the other possible
grandstanders but **ourselves**.[^thanks]
