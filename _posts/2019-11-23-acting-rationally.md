## The Short Version
Sometimes, it's more rational to act against your best judgment.

## The puzzle
{: id="anchor"}

I'm at my desk deliberating whether I should go to watch that new movie my
<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  Coincidentally, I've heard *Parasite* is pretty good...
</span>
friends have been raving on about or do some final edits for my term paper
due tonight. There's a lot riding on this term paper, and I know that my
papers have always greatly improved from these final touch-ups.

In the end,
I decide that it would be best to do some final edits and stay in tonight. But
as soon as I reach my decision, one of my friends calls me and asks me if I'm coming.
After a moment of hesitation, I agree to come.

What went wrong here? Most people would agree that I've done something
irrational. It was my best judgment to work on my paper, but I acted against it by
going to watch the movie.

In general, most (if not all) people seem to assume that acting against
your best judgment is always irrational. However, in a surprising move, Nomy
Arpaly argues that this assumption is actually wrong.[^paper] In other words,
there are cases where it is actually more rational to act against your
best judgment.

[^paper]: Arpaly, N. (2000). On Acting Rationally against One's Best Judgment. *Ethics* 110(3), 488-513.

## A distinction
I need to first clarify exactly what Arpaly is arguing for. Arpaly is not arguing
that in some cases like the movie example I should think to myself "Oh, I should act against my
<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  Assuming that there is a way to figure out if I'm in a case where I should
  act against my best judgment.
</span>
best judgment so I should go watch the movie" and go with my friends.

In this sort of case, my
best judgment would have flipped from 'work on the term paper more' to
'go watch the movie with friends'. This means I'm not really acting against
my best judgment. I'm just switching what my best judgment is. In Arpaly's
words:

> Do I offer the advice, then, that we should sometimes act against
> our best judgments? I do not. (p.491-492)

What Arpaly is arguing is that if we are offering an account of when someone
acts rationally or irrationally, we cannot assume that acting against her
best judgment is always irrational. In the movie example, this would be accepting
the possibility that I could look back the day after the movie and
realize going to watch the movie was actually a more rational action than
working on the paper.

## Consider the following

Arpaly asks us to consider Emily who is getting a Ph.D. in chemistry but for
various reasons is feeling a sense of dissatisfaction and
lack of motivation to continue her
program. Emily's best judgment is that she should continue pursuing a Ph.D., but
it turns out that her dissatisfaction and lack of motivation are caused by good reasons that she
should actually quit.

For example, her talents might lie elsewhere and the
program might not fit her research interests. All these reasons contribute
to her dissatisfaction and lack of motivation, but when she deliberates whether she should continue
<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  Maybe it's because she's suppressing these reasons,
  but hey, I'm not a psychologist
  how should I know?
</span>
the program, she does not consider these reasons for whatever reason.

But one day, "on an impulse," she quits after these negative feelings grow too
much for her to handle (p.504). She might call her action irrational since she
still thinks her best judgment is to stick with the program, but a few years
later she realizes why she felt so dissatisfied with the program. Now, when
someone asks her why she quit she says that her talents lied elsewhere and
that the program did not fit her research interests.

Arpaly thinks that this case shows that Emily is actually more rational in
quitting (acting against her best judgment) than sticking with the program
by going with her best judgment.

## An objection

An immediate objection to this example
and one that I also had was this: Arpaly seems to
assume incorrectly that "one can act for good reasons...without knowing
that one is acting for good reasons" (p.505). How is it possible to act
for the right reasons if I don't even know I'm acting for the right reasons? This seems
more like a happy coincidence.
Emily does not act for the right
reasons because she did not deliberate and reach the conclusion to quit
based on these reasons. Only then would she act for the right reasons and be
rational in quitting. It seems necessary for acting rationally that I deliberate.

<!-- DOUBLE CHECK THE FORMULATION OF THE OBJECTION -->

## Rational action without deliberation

Arpaly responds to the objection by showing there are plenty of cases
where we act rationally without deliberation.

### Fast actions

Arpaly gives the example of a tennis player in a match. The tennis player
does not have the time to deliberate on all her actions during the match. Some
<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  I have strong doubts about this claim, and it seems like an
  empirical question that psychologists would be in a much
  better position to answer whether the tennis player really
  does not deliberate before some of her actions.
</span>
of her actions happen so quickly that the player does not deliberate before
her action. However, we do praise the tennis player for even actions like these
where there is no prior deliberation. We might say a player was "brilliant"
in one play, meaning we attribute rationality to a player's action even if
there was no prior deliberation.

### Dawning

I found this the most interesting set of cases Arpaly considers. Dawning is
"cases in which people change their minds, sans [without] deliberation,
as a result of a long period of exposure to new evidence" (p.508).

Arpaly considers an alternative story of Emily. This time Emily realizes at the
end of her third year in the program that she should quit. This happens because
over the course of her three years she registers in her mind all the
right reasons to quit, but she does not include them in her deliberations about whether
she should
continue the program. At the end of her third year, this gradual process of
registering all the reasons to quit makes her realize she should quit. In
other words, it dawns
on her that she should quit. This is different from before because her best
judgment changes, but she does not deliberate at any point about reasons
to quit. Thus, Emily rationally quits but did not deliberate at any point to quit.[^fringe]

[^fringe]: I wonder if Arpaly's cases are really just fringe cases that point out problems with our ordinary conception of deliberation. Fast actions and dawning still are cases with deliberation (at least they seem so to me), but the deliberation in these fringe cases is a different conception of deliberation than the ordinary one.

## The takeaway

Arpaly seems to have shown that it's actually harder than we might think to distinguish
between when we are acting rationally
and when we are acting irrationally. Even if I have deliberated and reached a conclusion
about what I should do, I might be ignoring reasons that
would convince me the other action is more rational. I have to now seriously
ask myself, when I'm deliberating, whether that feeling of dissatisfaction is
caused by some good reason I'm not considering.

If Arpaly is right, there's nothing special about our best judgment
when we deliberate about what to do. It could be more rational to act against your
best judgment.
