## The Short Version
You should defer to the expert consensus instead of thinking critically.

## The puzzle
{: id="anchor"}

This is a personal favorite of mine from Michael Huemer (2005).[^paper]
Take any controversial public issue of your time. For me, this includes
issues such as abortion and gun rights. To make this easier,
let us assume there is a fact of the matter for these issues; that is,
there is a right answer to these issues. There are at least 3 strategies you
may employ to make up your mind on the matter: (1) deference--adopt
the belief that most experts hold, (2) critical thinking--after
conducting your own investigation of the issue, you assess the
arguments and evidence to come to your own conclusion, (3) skepticism--withhold
judgment on the issue.[^discrepancy] The puzzle is this: which
strategy should you choose?

[^paper]: Huemer, M. (2005). Is critical thinking epistemically responsible? *Metaphilosophy* 36(4), 522-531.

[^discrepancy]: Huemer actually calls (1) 'credulity', but I think 'deference' is a better name.

To help us choose, Huemer takes us on a quick detour with a simple
thought experiment. Consider two devices, A and B, that measure some
property F. A is 80 percent accurate, meaning "80 percent
of the time it correctly reports
whether a thing is F," and B is 60 percent accurate (Huemer, 524).
Presumably, you would choose device A to figure out if something is F.
You want to use the device that is more accurate.

  Skepticism is not an option if I want/have to form a belief
  on the matter so I think it's more interesting to consider
  only the first 2 strategies.
</span>
With this conclusion in mind, consider just deference
and critical thinking. By using deference, you are more likely to
form a true belief because an expert, especially a group of experts,
is more likely than you (assuming you are a layperson on the issue)
to arrive at a true belief on the matter. No matter how much research
you may have done, you as a layperson are no match for a group
of experts who have dedicated a lengthy portion of their lives
studying the issue.

In this way, choosing
deference is like choosing device A over device B.
<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  For me, this is a deeply disturbing conclusion. We
  preach the importance of critical thinking, but this
  argument shows that if we care about having true beliefs
  we should defer to the experts.
</span>
Deference is more accurate than critical thinking so by the
same reasoning that we choose device A we should choose deference
over critical thinking.

When should we choose skepticism then? We choose skepticism
in cases where deference is not possible. This may mean there is no
expert consensus or maybe it is difficult for you
to figure out what the expert consensus is.

But even in this case, you should not choose critical thinking.
If there is no expert consensus and you arrive at some belief
through critical thinking, why should you think you're likely
to have arrived at a true belief? After all, even the experts couldn't
agree on what the right answer is so it's unlikely that you
have arrived at the right belief. Thus, even in this case,
you should not choose critical thinking and instead opt
for skepticism.

## The dilemma
<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  And really anyone else who supports critical thinking.
</span>
Those who teach critical thinking face a dilemma.
Suppose you teach a critical thinking course and one of your
students who took your course last semester tells you that
after employing the critical thinking skills she acquired
from your course
she now believes we should abolish the use of the death penalty.
Supposing that you are not an expert on this issue, should
you now also believe that we should abolish the death penalty?

If you think yes, this is a strike against critical thinking. Why?
*You* did not use critical thinking to arrive at the belief that
we should abolish the use of the death penalty. So you should not
agree with your student just yet.

<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  I think Huemer is wrong here. I don't have to
  answer yes (or no), meaning I am now
  fully confident (or fully unconfident) that we
  should abolish the death penalty. I could
  have a slightly higher or lower degree of confidence
  that we should abolish the death penalty, and I may be still unsure
  whether we should abolish it.
</span>
But if you think no, this is also a strike against critical thinking.
If the critical thinking skills you teach are what this student used
to arrive at the belief that we should abolish the use of the death penalty,
then your saying no is a "negative assessment" of those very skills
you taught (Huemer, 526). Effectively, you are saying that using
the critical thinking skills you taught are not enough to convince
someone of the truth of your belief.


<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  Asking the student for her reasons is also a strike against
  critical thinking because this means that her using critical
  thinking is not good enough for you to hold the same belief.
</span>
The upshot is this: it seems that if I use critical thinking to
form some belief then only I have good reason to hold that
belief. Even if I tell others of the belief, they would not have
good reason to hold the same belief unless they thought through
the issue critically on their own.

## Some objections
And that's the gist of the paper!
To wrap up, here are a few common/interesting objections
that Huemer anticipates.

### Why not choose both?
You might object that we don't have to choose between deference
and critical thinking. We can weight the two in a new strategy
that combines the two.

But Huemer replies that even in such a strategy you should give
very little--if any--weight to critical thinking. Because a group
of experts is more (probably much more) reliable than you are,
it doesn't make sense to give significant weight to critical thinking.
This means that the new combined strategy will really be no different
from deference.

### The aim of critical thinking
You might object that Huemer misunderstands the aim of critical
thinking. The aim of critical thinking is not just to form a
true belief. The aim also includes things like forming a
*reasonable* belief or a *justified* belief.

<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  I think Huemer isn't being very charitable with this objection.
  Surely, what you mean by raising this objection is that your
  belief acquired from deference is not justified by the same
  reasons the experts have. You don't know why the experts
  hold the belief. This means that though your belief
  may be more likely to be true it is not justified.
</span>
But Huemer points out that experts are more likely than you are
to hold reasonable beliefs or justified beliefs on the issue so
you should still defer to experts if the aim of critical thinking
is to acquire reasonable or justified beliefs.

### Self-undermining
<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  It's also self-undermining in that if you defer to
  experts on whether to choose deference or critical
  thinking then you will find the consensus is to
  choose critical thinking. How paradoxical!
</span>
You might object that Huemer actually offers a self-undermining
argument. For you to accept his conclusion that you should choose
deference or skepticism instead of critical thinking, you have
to use critical thinking! How can you use critical thinking to
arrive at the belief that you shouldn't use critical thinking!

<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  Needless to say, I don't buy this reply.
</span>
Huemer replies that the audience of his paper is other experts
so that when people are deciding between deference and critical
thinking the expert consensus will be for deference.

### How to identify experts
You might object that we still have to use critical thinking to
identify who the experts are. Huemer actually concedes this
and writes that he actually supports the more "modest thesis"
that only for the issue itself we should not use critical thinking (529).
